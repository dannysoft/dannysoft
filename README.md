- 👋 Hi, I’m Danny, aka @dannysoft
- 👀 I’m interested in lots of stuff; if I said computer programming would that be to obvious?  But music, sport, sci-fi; the usual stuff for programmer types. (live long and ...you know the rest)
- 🌱 I’m currently always upping my Python knowledge.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Python projects; it is all fun problem solving. 
- 📫 How to reach me daniel_stevenson@hotmail.com
